// A "branch" in Git is like a timeline in your repository
// If you wanted to work on developing a new idea for this crazy large program, you can create a 
//      new branch that is apart from the main branch so that you're not touching the "official"
//      stable version of the program.
git branch      // returns what branch you're on and a list of branches
git checkout master     // go back to the top of the master branch
git branch <new-branch-name>    // create another timeline where you can experiment new additions
                                //  to the master code
git checkout <branch-name>      // navigate to a different branch
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>   // create a new timeline and change to it 
git branch -d <branch-name>     // delete a branch
git merge <branch-name>         // finally merge all the new tried and tested features of a timeline idea
                                //  into the master branch.
